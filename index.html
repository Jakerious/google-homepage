    My idea I guess would be to have a div with just the entire top row, maybe do a flexbox sort of thing,
    one for the middle of the page, then one for the bottom.
    another issue I need to deal with is figuring out how the search bar works. There is a looking glass on left
    and a mic on right, but text only goes in the middle of bar. I would think that there would be a div
    with the background made already and merely a textbox in the middle.

    You got this jacob, no more halfassing stuff just cause it is hard.
